#### Goal
In this project we would like to analyze the success rate of a campaign hosted on kicstarter. Some of the questions that we would like to address are :
What are the factors contributing towards the success or failure of a project?
For a campaign owner to launch a project, what parameters should be considered in order for it to be a success ?
**Our analysis aims at building a classification model to predict the success or failure of a new project with a given goal and timeline**

#### Audience
We are aiming for this analysis will be useful to people who are interested in raising funds for their cause, so that they can decide the amount that should be set as their goal and the timeline within which this goal can be achieved, in order to have a successful campaign.

#### Source of data
This analysis is based on datasets that is obtained by webscrapping services provided by WebRobots.
Using the WebRobots tools, information is extracted from the Kickstarter website.
There were 56 files from years 2009 to 2019.
All of the 56 files were merged into a single file and some unwanted columns dropped before cleaning the data further.
